# 📱 PWA Installation Guide

## Overview
Aimo Pulse is now configured as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that can be installed on iOS and Android devices. Users can add it to their home screen and use it like a native app.

## ✅ What's Included
- ✅ **Add to Home Screen** support for iOS and Android
- ✅ **Offline Support** with automatic caching
- ✅ **Standalone Mode** (runs without browser UI)
- ✅ **Auto-updates** when new versions are deployed
- ❌ **NO Push Notifications** (simplified setup)

## 📲 How Users Install the App

### iOS (Safari)
1. Open the app in Safari
2. Tap the **Share** button (box with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Tap **"Add"** in the top right
5. The app icon will appear on your home screen

### Android (Chrome)
1. Open the app in Chrome
2. Tap the **menu** (three dots)
3. Tap **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install app"**
4. Tap **"Install"** in the popup

2. Look for the **install icon** (➕) in the address bar
3. Click **"Install"**
4. The app will open in its own window

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Configured:
- `/vite.config.ts` - PWA plugin configuration
- `/src/main.tsx` - Service worker registration
- `/index.html` - iOS meta tags
- `/public/logo.svg` - App icon (used for all sizes)

### Features:
- **Service Worker:** Auto-generated by Vite PWA plugin
- **Caching Strategy:** NetworkFirst for Supabase API calls
- **Manifest:** Auto-generated with brand colors (#A83FFF gradient)
- **Icons:** SVG with "any" and "maskable" purposes

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. **No additional setup required** - Just deploy to Vercel as normal
2. **No VAPID keys needed** - Push notifications are disabled
3. **Automatic updates** - Users get updates when they refresh
4. **Works offline** - Basic caching for better performance

## 📝 In-App Notifications

The app still has **in-app notifications** (bell icon in header) that work normally:
- ✅ Nudge notifications
- ✅ Mood update alerts
- ✅ Message notifications
- ✅ Doodle notifications

These are **NOT** push notifications - they only appear when the app is open.

## ⚙️ Future: Adding Push Notifications

If you want to add push notifications later:
1. Generate VAPID keys: `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`
2. Add keys to Supabase secrets
3. Implement push subscription logic
4. Configure service worker for push events

For now, the app works great without push notifications! 🎉
